*A Julia wrapper of the automatic differentiation package ADOL-C*
  
This package wraps the C/C++ automatic differentiation library [ADOL-C](https://github.com/coin-or/ADOL-C) for use in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). 

Currently, the ADOL-C binaries are built for Julia 1.9, 1.10, and 1.11, and they are not compiled for musl libc.  
To use this package, type 
```jl
using Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/TimSiebert1/ADOLC.jl")
using ADOLC
```
  
First- and second-order derivatives can be calculated as follows
```jl
f(x) = [x[1]*x[2]^2, x[1]^2*x[3]^3]
x = [1.0, 2.0, -1.0]
dir = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
weights = [1.0, 1.0]
res = derivative(f, x, :vec_hess_vec, dir=dir, weights=weights)

# output

3-element Vector{Float64}:
 -2.0
  4.0
  6.0
```

There are various available modes for [first-](https://timsiebert1.github.io/ADOLC.jl/dev/lib/derivative_modes/#First-Order) and [second-order](https://timsiebert1.github.io/ADOLC.jl/dev/lib/derivative_modes/#Second-Order) calculations. The computation of higher-order derivatives is explained [here](https://timsiebert1.github.io/ADOLC.jl/dev/lib/derivative_modes/#Higher-Order) and works as sketched below
```jl
f(x) = [x[1]^2*x[2]^2, x[3]^2*x[4]^2]
x = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
partials = [[1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [2, 2, 0, 0]]
res = derivative(f, x, partials)

# output

2Ã—3 Matrix{Float64}:
 8.0   0.0  4.0
 0.0  48.0  0.0
```


For advanced users, there is a [list](https://timsiebert1.github.io/ADOLC.jl/dev/lib/wrapped_fcts/) of all functions wrapped from ADOL-C.
